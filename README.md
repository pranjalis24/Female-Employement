#Female Employment vs Socio-economic Factors 
This project is driven by a profound commitment to understanding and improving the socio-economic status of women through data analysis. 
Goal is to provide detailed insights into how various factors influence female employment across different sectors in Bangladesh, using data from surveys, the World Bank, and other global organizations.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this research is to analyze the interplay between socio-economic parameters and female employment. This analysis is vital for stakeholders, including government bodies, educational institutions, policy makers, NGOs, MNCs, and the general public. By uncovering trends and patterns in employment data, we aim to assist in the formulation of policies that enhance the socio-economic conditions for women.

### Key Insights and Conclusions

The project highlights the significant relationship between female employment in agriculture, industry, and services with various socio-economic factors. Our findings indicate a shift in employment patterns, with a notable decrease in vulnerability and an increase in women participating in private ventures. This shift signifies growing risk-taking capacity and self-confidence among women. Our data-driven approach provides a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics, supporting stakeholders in making informed decisions.
